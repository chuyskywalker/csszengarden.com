# csszengarden.com

The official repo of the CSS Zen Garden.

Pull requests with improvements welcomed, but remember that changes to the
HTML file affect the entire archive of 200+ designs. If you're changing the
markup, you'll need to commit changes to all designs affected.

If you plan to submit new designs as pull requests, please create a new branch
and submit that as a pull request instead of issuing a PR against master.

If that makes no sense, just use the traditional submission form:
